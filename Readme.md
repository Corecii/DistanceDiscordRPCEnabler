Save level editor schemes to `/Distance/Distance_Data/Resources/EditorConfig/*.xml`

Scheme A is `BlenderToolInputCombos.xml`
Scheme B is `UnityToolInputCombos.xml`

You can save changes, then exit and re-enter the editor to test them out.  
Haven't tested what happens if you mess up though. Might break spectacularly.

To reset to default, remove the config files and restart Distance.
